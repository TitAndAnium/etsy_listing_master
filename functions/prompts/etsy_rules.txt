# etsy_rules_v2.txt — Platform Compliance & Enforcement Layer
# Versie 2.0 — Opgesteld: 2025-05-25

=== FORMAT & CHARACTER RULES ===
- All content must be strictly ASCII-only.
- No emojis, smart quotes, or typographic punctuation allowed.
- All text must be in plain text format (no markdown, bullets only via ASCII).
- Tags must be lowercase only, comma-separated, and ≤ 20 characters each.
- Titles must be ≤ 140 characters (Etsy enforced limit).
- Description blocks must use this order (if used): Overview, Features, Personalization, Sizes, Care, Shipping.

=== PROHIBITED CONTENT ===
- No links, domains, coupon codes, or external references.
- No price references (e.g. "only $9.99", "10% off").
- No claims that violate Etsy's trust policy: "fastest", "safest", "guaranteed", etc.
- No vague seller-perspective claims: "great quality", "amazing item", "top seller".

=== SEARCH & SEO STRUCTURE ===
- The first 5 words in a title must include the main focus keyword.
- Do not repeat the same keyword or synonym across title, tags, and category (Etsy penalizes stacking).
- Avoid overlapping keywords between tags and categories (use complementary terms).
- Use search language as buyers phrase it — not seller jargon.
- Each field must serve a distinct SEO purpose:
  - Title: keyword visibility + scroll-stopping relevance
  - Tags: long-tail reach + buyer intent diversity
  - Description: conversion logic + tone/emotion alignment

=== INPUT PRIORITY (FOR AI SYSTEM) ===
- Visual > mockup > user description > dump → hierarchy of trust
- If visual data strongly implies a product type or tone, it overrides text-based input.
- If dump contains raw Etsy JSON, normalize before use — discard UI noise.

=== FIELD SYNC & TONE ALIGNMENT ===
- Tags must never contradict the tone or intent of the title or description.
- If personalization is active, all layers must include a matching cue.
- Seasonal context must align across tags, tone, and emotional framing.
- Descriptions must never promise customization unless personalization = true.

=== CONTEXTUAL GIFTING RULES ===
- If gift_mode = true but no gift_emotion is set → fallback to "thoughtful" tone or "neutral-emotive" override.
- Do not use gifting phrases (e.g., "makes a perfect gift") unless emotionally supported by context.
- If buyer_vs_receiver = "receiver", descriptions must avoid sales tone and use recipient-focused phrasing.

=== TECHNICAL BEHAVIOR ENFORCEMENT ===
- If rules are violated:
  - Retry prompt with correction
  - Log invalid segment in Firestore (by field)
  - Trigger fallback path if multiple violations persist

RETURN NO OUTPUT IF STRUCTURE FAILS — fallback must take over.


[PLATFORM POLICIES]
- Do not include misleading claims, fake urgency, or brand name abuse.
- All listings must comply with Etsy's IP, copyright, and community standards.
- Use clear and correct English unless otherwise specified.
- Do not include personal data, external links, or contact information.
- Listings must be importable into Etsy with no validation errors.

[LISTING STRUCTURE]
- Every product must include: title, tags, description, category, and at least one image.
- Each field must be unique — no repetition of identical or synonymous words across title, tags, and category.
- No price-like patterns allowed in any field (e.g. $12, 2.99, 3–5).
- If personalization is offered, it must be clearly explained and usable by the buyer.
- Materials and sizing must be specified if required by Etsy's category structure.

[CONTENT RESTRICTIONS]
- Avoid banned or risky keywords, including medical claims or adult content.
- Subculture, seasonal or niche terms are allowed only if visually or contextually justified.
- Evergreen framing is preferred unless strong seasonal relevance is confirmed via metadata or image.
- The product title must truthfully describe what is being sold (no phantom bundles or misleading framing).

[INPUT PRIORITY]
- Visual input always overrides conflicting text input.
- If there is a mismatch between the image and dump/manual data: use the visual product as primary source of truth.
