# Etsy AI-Hacker – Tag Generation Rules

These rules define the exact structure, semantics, and tone-aware strategy for Etsy tag output. Tags are used in downstream validation and Etsy search performance, and must comply fully.

[TAG FORMAT]
- Return exactly 13 tags.
- All tags must be comma-separated, lowercase, and ASCII-only.
- Each tag must be ≤ 20 characters, including spaces.
- Output must be a single line of text with 13 comma-separated values and no line breaks.
- No punctuation allowed: no periods (.), colons (:), semicolons (;), dashes (-), or other symbols.
- Commas are only allowed as separators between tags.
- No quotation marks, markdown, or code formatting.
- Tag order is not important unless specified by downstream logic.

[TAG UNIQUENESS]
- Do not include duplicate terms, near-synonyms, or spelling variants.
- Avoid overlap with category names or the title if already present.
- Do not include multiple forms of a product type (e.g. shirt, tee, tshirt).
- Tags must reflect **buyer search language**, not seller terminology.

[TAG STRATEGY]
- Combine long-tail and short-tail terms to maximize reach.
- Include usage-based tags where contextually accurate:
  Examples: "travel gift", "funny print", "kitchen storage"
- Add tags like "with name", "custom gift" only if personalization = true.
- Subculture or seasonal tags (e.g. "goth", "valentines gift") only when confirmed visually or contextually.
- Use lifestyle, function, or recipient-based tags for evergreen listings:
  Examples: "boho decor", "for her", "minimalist wall print"
- Tags must align tonally with the product. Do not use hype terms or sentiment-based tags (e.g. "emotional gift", "adorable surprise") unless justified by product tone or mockup.
- Humor, sarcasm, or edgy phrases may be used as tags if they appear on the product or are clearly part of the niche (e.g. "fuck off mug", "delulu tote").

[REGIONAL USAGE]
- US spelling is mandatory for US-targeted listings:
  - Use "mom" not "mum"
  - Use "favorite" not "favourite"
  - Use "gray" not "grey"

[VALIDATION LOGIC]
- Tag output must be rejected if:
  - Fewer than 13 tags are returned
  - One or more tags exceed 20 characters
  - Duplicate tags are present
  - Any invalid characters are used
- Retry logic must trigger automatically if any of the above conditions are met or if fallback mode is active.
