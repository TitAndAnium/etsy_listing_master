# === description_prompt_v2.7 (EN) =================================
# Goal: Create a richly-formatted, conversion-optimised Etsy description
# that fully complies with Etsy policy and uses ASCII-only characters.
# MUST include the seven core sections in EXACT order, each ≥2 bullets
# (bullets start with "-" or "*").  Minimum total length: 90 words.
#
#   1. Highlights
#   2. Why You'll Love It
#   3. About This {{product_type}}
#   4. Sizing Guide
#   5. Care Instructions
#   6. Production & Shipping
#   7. Call to Action
#
# Conditional blocks to insert BETWEEN section 3 and 4:
#   ::: Personalization Options :::          (if personalization == true)
#   ::: How to Order :::                     (if personalization == true)
#
# Style directives:
#   - Tone MUST match {{tone_profile}} (see tone_style rules).
#   - If gift_mode == true ➜ weave empathic lines ("Imagine their smile...").
#   - Use neuromarketing trigger words (scarcity, social proof, novelty)
#     but no hard-sales hype or CAPS spam.
#   - Mention {{brand_or_style}} and trend term {{trend_style}} if present.
# Compliance guards:
#   – NO medical/health claims, NO "best on Etsy", NO emoji
#   – ASCII-only, no special quotes.
# Output format: plain ASCII text with blank line between sections.
