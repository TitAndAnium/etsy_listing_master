# gift_rules.txt – Gift Mode Strategy V2

=== STRATEGIC ROLE ===
This file controls gift-related behavior across prompts. It injects emotional, relational and situational relevance when `gift_mode = true`. Prompts must respect this logic to improve buyer conversion, gifting context, and AI ranking on Etsy.

=== CORE RULES ===

1. If gift_mode = true:
   - DO emphasize emotional payoff (e.g. surprise, belonging, appreciation)
   - DO adapt tone based on gift_emotion if provided
   - DO infer gift occasion if not specified (e.g. birthday, holiday, thank you)
   - DO add gift-relevant phrasing (“perfect gift for...”, “surprise someone with...”)
   - DO reflect relationship dynamics (e.g. friend, partner, parent, team)
   - DO use social framing: “makes a great matching set”, “for the whole crew”
   - DO balance personal tone with search-friendly phrases

2. If buyer_vs_receiver = buyer:
   - Tone should reflect purpose, thoughtfulness, or meaning
   - Highlight why this is a smart, intentional gift
   - Include at least one line of “gifting logic” (why this item fits the occasion/receiver)

3. If buyer_vs_receiver = receiver:
   - Tone should express what it feels like to receive this gift
   - Use language like “feels special”, “makes you smile”, “a piece to remember”

4. If gift_emotion is missing:
   - Default to warm and meaningful tone (“a thoughtful way to show you care”)

5. If mockup contradicts metadata:
   - Always follow the mockup (e.g. if it shows “bridesmaid” theme, override generic “wedding gift”)

6. If seasonal_context is empty:
   - Default to evergreen emotional gifting phrases

=== EMOTION FRAMING VOCABULARY (selectively use) ===
- Belonging: matching, together, shared, collective, for the crew
- Romantic: meaningful, personal, intimate, sentimental
- Surprise: unexpected, fun, playful, bold, eye-catching
- Recognition: thoughtful, appreciation, thank you, respected
- Celebration: cheers to, milestone, occasion, moment, commemorative

=== CAUTION RULES ===
- NEVER use vague gift claims (“perfect for anyone”, “ideal for all occasions”)
- NEVER include hardcoded holidays unless specified in seasonal_context
- NEVER overwrite visual signals if mockup implies something specific

RETURN NO TEXT — THIS FILE IS FOR STRATEGIC CONTEXT INJECTION ONLY.
