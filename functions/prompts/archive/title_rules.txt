# Etsy AI-Hacker – Title Generation Rules

This file defines the output format, character rules, tone logic and SEO strategy for Etsy titles. Titles are essential for visibility, click-through rate, and Etsy search indexing. Prompt output must comply fully.

[TITLE FORMAT]
- Max 140 characters (including spaces and punctuation).
- ASCII-only: no emoji, special symbols, smart quotes, or markdown.
- One single title line, no line breaks.
- No trailing punctuation such as periods (.), exclamation marks (!), colons (:), or quotation marks (").
- No price-like patterns: no $12, 3.99, 2–4, etc.
- No quotation marks or ALL CAPS phrases.
- No ALL CAPS phrases allowed. Only a single word may be in ALL CAPS, and only if visually or contextually justified (e.g. BRIDE).
- Numbers are allowed only when contextually essential (e.g. “set of 3”), but may never be used as the first word of the title.

[KEYWORD STRATEGY]
- The **focus keyword must appear within the first 5 words** of the title.
- Titles must reflect actual buyer search behavior.
- Do not include synonym stacking: e.g. “shirt, tee, t-shirt” → reject.
- Use only one product term variation per title.
- Avoid vague adjectives or hype language: “awesome”, “best”, “perfect”.
- Do not include brand names or shop names unless required by Etsy category policy or user-provided input.

[TONE & INTENT]
- Titles must align with the product’s emotional and visual tone.
- Humor, irony or bold phrasing is allowed when supported by the product design, niche or cultural expectations (e.g. sarcastic shirts, novelty gifts).
- Titles must be buyer-facing, not seller-oriented (“Great for your store” = reject).
- Personalization must be mentioned within the first 7 words if personalization = true.
- Gift-intent must be implied when Gift Mode is active (e.g. “custom gift”, “anniversary sweater”).
- Tone must match the listing as a whole — avoid inconsistencies with tags or description tone.

[VISUAL ALIGNMENT]
- Image is the primary source of truth.
- If image and metadata conflict, override input with the visible product identity.
- Tone, keyword and structure must follow the visual style: minimal, bold, romantic, edgy, etc.

[CONFLICT RULES]
- If tone intent is unclear, match the tone to the product’s visual identity or the most dominant audience signal.
- Do not default to a “neutral” title out of uncertainty if visual or contextual indicators suggest bold, humorous or niche tone.

[VALIDATION RULES]
- Title output must be rejected if:
  - Exceeds 140 characters
  - Contains illegal characters or emoji
  - Repeats terms or violates stacking rules
  - Lacks focus keyword in first 5 words
- Retry logic triggers if:
  - Title is empty, invalid, or does not pass length and keyword checks
